            <h2>Poker (Texas Hold'em)</h2>
            <img src="image_poker.jpg" alt="Poker (Texas Hold'em)">
            <p><strong>Number of players:</strong> 2 to 10</p>
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> A deck of 54 cards (52 cards + 2 jokers).</p>
            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dealing:</strong> Each player receives 2 private cards, called "hole cards," which can only be seen by them. Then, five community cards are placed face up on the table in three stages: the "flop" (3 cards), the "turn" (1 card), and the "river" (1 card). These community cards are used by all players to form their hand.</li>
                <li><strong>Bets:</strong> The game consists of several betting rounds. Players have the option to call, which means matching the current bet, raise, which means increasing the bet, or fold, which means giving up the hand and no longer participating in the pot. Betting decisions are crucial and can influence the course of the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Combinations:</strong> Players must form the best 5-card hand using their 2 private cards and the 5 community cards. Hand combinations range from a pair (two cards of the same value) to a royal flush (a sequence of five cards of the same suit from 10 to Ace). Knowing the hierarchy of hands is essential to evaluate the strength of one's hand compared to that of other players.</li>
                <li><strong>Showdown:</strong> If multiple players remain in the game after the last betting round, a "showdown" occurs. Players reveal their cards, and the player with the best hand wins the pot. In case of a tie, the pot is split among the involved players.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Game Progression:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Players place initial bets, called "blinds," which are mandatory bets to encourage action.</li>
                <li>Each player receives their private cards, which are hidden from the other players.</li>
                <li>The first betting round begins, where players can choose to call, raise, or fold.</li>
                <li>The flop is revealed, consisting of three community cards, followed by a betting round where players evaluate their hand with the new cards.</li>
                <li>The turn is revealed, adding a fourth community card, followed by another betting round.</li>
                <li>The river is revealed, adding the fifth and final community card, followed by a last betting round where players make their final decision.</li>
                <li>The remaining players reveal their cards during the showdown, and the winner is determined based on the best hand.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Strategic Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluate the strength of your hand against the community cards. Consider the possible combinations you can form with the cards on the table.</li>
                <li>Observe the betting tendencies of other players to assess their hands. Aggressive bets may indicate a strong hand, while cautious bets may signal a weak hand.</li>
                <li>Do not play every hand; choose your starting cards wisely. A good selection of starting hands can increase your chances of long-term success.</li>
            </ul>
