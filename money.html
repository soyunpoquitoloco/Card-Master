            <h2>Poker (Texas Hold'em)</h2>
            <p><strong>Number of players:</strong> 2 to 10</p>
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> A deck of 54 cards (52 cards + 2 jokers).</p>
            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dealing:</strong> Each player receives 2 private cards, called "hole cards," which can only be seen by them. Then, five community cards are placed face up on the table in three stages: the "flop" (3 cards), the "turn" (1 card), and the "river" (1 card). These community cards are used by all players to form their hand.</li>
                <li><strong>Bets:</strong> The game consists of several betting rounds. Players have the option to call, which means matching the current bet, raise, which means increasing the bet, or fold, which means giving up the hand and no longer participating in the pot. Betting decisions are crucial and can influence the course of the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Combinations:</strong> Players must form the best 5-card hand using their 2 private cards and the 5 community cards. Hand combinations range from a pair (two cards of the same value) to a royal flush (a sequence of five cards of the same suit from 10 to Ace). Knowing the hierarchy of hands is essential to evaluate the strength of one's hand compared to that of other players.</li>
                <li><strong>Showdown:</strong> If multiple players remain in the game after the last betting round, a "showdown" occurs. Players reveal their cards, and the player with the best hand wins the pot. In case of a tie, the pot is split among the involved players.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Game Progression:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Players place initial bets, called "blinds," which are mandatory bets to encourage action.</li>
                <li>Each player receives their private cards, which are hidden from the other players.</li>
                <li>The first betting round begins, where players can choose to call, raise, or fold.</li>
                <li>The flop is revealed, consisting of three community cards, followed by a betting round where players evaluate their hand with the new cards.</li>
                <li>The turn is revealed, adding a fourth community card, followed by another betting round.</li>
                <li>The river is revealed, adding the fifth and final community card, followed by a last betting round where players make their final decision.</li>
                <li>The remaining players reveal their cards during the showdown, and the winner is determined based on the best hand.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Strategic Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluate the strength of your hand against the community cards. Consider the possible combinations you can form with the cards on the table.</li>
                <li>Observe the betting tendencies of other players to assess their hands. Aggressive bets may indicate a strong hand, while cautious bets may signal a weak hand.</li>
                <li>Do not play every hand; choose your starting cards wisely. A good selection of starting hands can increase your chances of long-term success.</li>

            <h2>Blackjack</h2>
            <p><strong>Number of players:</strong> 1 to 7 players (against the dealer).</p>
            <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A deck of 54 cards (52 cards + 2 jokers) and chips for betting.</p>
            <h3>Game Objective:</h3>
            <p>The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. Players aim to have a higher total than the dealer without going over 21.</p>
            <h3>Game Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Card Values:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.</li>
                        <li>Face cards (kings, queens, jacks) are worth 10 points.</li>
                        <li>Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dealing Cards:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down (the hole card).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Player's Turn:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Players can choose to "Hit" (take another card) or "Stand" (keep their current hand).</li>
                        <li>Players can continue to hit until they choose to stand or exceed 21 (bust), which results in an automatic loss.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dealer's Turn:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card.</li>
                        <li>The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher (some casinos require the dealer to hit on a "soft 17," which includes an Ace valued as 11).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong>
                    <p>Players win if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without busting. The payouts are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Winning against the dealer: 1:1 payout.</li>
                        <li>Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card): 3:2 payout.</li>
                        <li>If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.</li>
                        <li>If a player and the dealer tie, it is a "push," and the player retains their bet.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Variants of Blackjack:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>European Blackjack:</strong> Players are dealt only one card face up initially, and the dealer's hole card is not revealed until after players have completed their turns.</li>
                <li><strong>Spanish 21:</strong> Played with a Spanish deck (no 10s), offering additional bonuses and rules that favor the player.</li>
                <li><strong>Blackjack Switch:</strong> Players are dealt two hands and can switch the second card of each hand to create stronger hands.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strategic Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Know When to Hit or Stand:</strong> Familiarize yourself with basic strategy charts that indicate the best action based on your hand and the dealer's upcard.</li>
                <li><strong>Manage Your Bankroll:</strong> Set a budget for your gambling session and stick to it to avoid losing more than you can afford.</li>
                <li><strong>Pay Attention to the Dealer's Upcard:</strong> The dealer's visible card can give you clues about their potential hand and help you make better decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Good Betting Strategy:</strong> Consider varying your bet sizes based on your confidence in your hand and the dealer's upcard.</li>

            <h2>Baccarat</h2>
            <p><strong>Number of players:</strong> 1 to 14 players (against the dealer).</p>
            <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A deck of 54 cards (52 cards + 2 jokers) and chips for betting.</p>
            <h3>Game Objective:</h3>
            <p>The objective of Baccarat is to bet on which hand will have a total value closest to 9: the "Player" hand, the "Banker" hand, or a tie.</p>
            <h3>Game Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Card Values:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Number cards (2-9) are worth their face value.</li>
                        <li>Tens and face cards (kings, queens, jacks) are worth 0 points.</li>
                        <li>Aces are worth 1 point.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dealing Cards:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two hands are dealt: one for the Player and one for the Banker. Each hand receives two cards.</li>
                        <li>Players can place bets on either the Player hand, the Banker hand, or a Tie before the cards are dealt.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Calculating Scores:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The total value of each hand is calculated by adding the values of the two cards. If the total exceeds 9, only the last digit is considered (e.g., a total of 15 counts as 5).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Third Card Rule:</strong>
                    <p>Depending on the total of the Player and Banker hands, a third card may be drawn according to specific rules:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the Player's total is 0-5, they draw a third card.</li>
                        <li>If the Player stands, the Banker draws a third card if their total is 0-5.</li>
                        <li>There are additional rules for the Banker drawing a third card based on the Player's third card.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong>
                    <p>The hand with the total closest to 9 wins. Winning bets are paid out as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Player bet wins: 1:1 payout.</li>
                        <li>Banker bet wins: 1:1 payout (minus a 5% commission).</li>
                        <li>Tie bet wins: 8:1 or 9:1 payout, depending on the casino.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Variants of Baccarat:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Punto Banco:</strong> The most common version of Baccarat played in casinos, where players bet on the outcome of the Player or Banker hands.</li>
                <li><strong>Baccarat Chemin de Fer:</strong> A version where players take turns being the Banker and can make decisions on drawing a third card.</li>
                <li><strong>Baccarat Banque:</strong> Similar to Chemin de Fer, but the Banker position is more permanent, and players can bet against the Banker.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strategic Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bet on the Banker:</strong> Statistically, betting on the Banker has a slightly better chance of winning, even with the commission.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Tie Bets:</strong> While the payout is tempting, the odds of a tie are low, making it a less favorable bet.</li>
                <li><strong>Manage Your Bankroll:</strong> Set a budget for your gaming session and stick to it to avoid overspending.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Calm and Enjoy:</strong> Baccarat is a game of chance, so enjoy the experience and avoid getting too caught up in the betting.</li>
