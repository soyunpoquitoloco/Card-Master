            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>We are student from the IFT (Institute for Future Technologies) at Pôle Léonard de Vinci. In order to learn how to launch a product as an independant we had to handle a yearly project 
                called "Quickstarter". The objective was to raise money from a fund raise and handle the production chain. In 2025, we launched our Kickstarter campain : the Card Master case.</p>
