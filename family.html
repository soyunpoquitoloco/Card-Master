            <h2>Rummy</h2>
            <img src="image_rami.jpg" alt="Rummy">
            <p><strong>Number of players:</strong> 2 to 6 players.</p>
            <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A deck of 54 cards (52 cards + 2 jokers).</p>
            <h3>Game Objective:</h3>
            <p>The objective of Rummy is to form combinations of cards (sets or sequences) and to get rid of all your cards. The first player to lay down all their cards in combinations wins the game.</p>
            <h3>Game Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dealing Cards:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each player receives 10 cards if the number of players is 2 to 4, or 7 cards if the number of players is 5 to 6.</li>
                        <li>The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the first card from the draw pile is turned over to start the discard pile.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Types of Combinations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sets: Three or four cards of the same value (e.g., 7 of hearts, 7 of clubs, 7 of diamonds).</li>
                        <li>Sequences: Three or more consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 4, 5, and 6 of spades).</li>
                        <li>Jokers can be used as wild cards to complete sets or sequences.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Turn Progression:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The player whose turn it is starts by drawing a card, either from the draw pile or the discard pile.</li>
                        <li>After drawing, the player can lay down combinations on the table (if they wish) or keep their cards.</li>
                        <li>The player ends their turn by discarding a card onto the discard pile.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Lay Down Combinations:</strong>
                    <p>A player can lay down combinations at any time during their turn, but they must first have a valid combination to "close" the game. To close, a player must lay down all their cards in combinations, including the card they discard at the end of their turn.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>End of the Game:</strong>
                    <p>The game ends when a player successfully lays down all their cards in combinations. The other players count the points of their remaining cards. Numbered cards (2 to 10) are worth their face value, face cards (jacks, queens, kings) are worth 10 points, and aces are worth 1 point. Jokers are worth 15 points. The player with the fewest points at the end of the game is the winner.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Variants of Rummy:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Two-player Rummy:</strong> Each player receives 7 cards, and the basic rules remain the same. Players can lay down combinations at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Three or Four-player Rummy:</strong> Players receive 10 cards, and the basic rules apply. Players can also choose to play with jokers or without.</li>
                <li><strong>Point Rummy:</strong> Instead of playing until a player gets rid of all their cards, players can play multiple rounds and count points at the end of each round. The player with the fewest points after a certain number of rounds is the winner.</li>
                <li><strong>Rummy with Jokers:</strong> Jokers can be used as wild cards to complete combinations, but they may also have special rules, such as not being able to be used in a set of 4 cards.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strategic Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Keep an eye on the cards that other players draw and discard. This can give you clues about the combinations they are trying to form.</li>
                <li><strong>Card Management:</strong> Try to keep cards that can be used in multiple combinations. For example, a 5 of hearts can be used in a sequence with a 4 and a 6, or in a set with other 5s.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of Jokers:</strong> Jokers are powerful cards. Use them wisely to complete combinations, but keep in mind that they can also cost you points if you fail to get rid of your cards.</li>
                <li><strong>Close Quickly:</strong> If you have a good hand, try to close quickly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Homemade Uno</h2>
            <img src="image_uno.jpg" alt="Homemade Uno">
            <p><strong>Number of players:</strong> 2 to 10 players.</p>
            <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A deck of 54 cards (52 cards + 2 jokers). To play Uno, you can use numbered cards and face cards, assigning them specific values and actions.</p>
            <h3>Game Objective:</h3>
            <p>The objective of the game is to get rid of all your cards before the other players. The first player to have no cards left wins the game.</p>
            <h3>Game Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dealing Cards:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each player receives 7 cards.</li>
                        <li>The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the first card from the draw pile is turned over to start the discard pile.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Types of Cards:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Numbered cards (2 to 10): These cards can be played if they match the color or number of the card on top of the discard pile.</li>
                        <li>Jokers: Jokers can be used to change the game color or for special actions (like skipping a turn or forcing another player to draw cards).</li>
                        <li>Special Cards: You can create special cards using face cards (jacks, queens, kings) to add actions such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Jack: Reverse the direction of play.</li>
                                <li>Queen: Skip the next player's turn.</li>
                                <li>King: Force the next player to draw 2 cards.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Turn Progression:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The player whose turn it is must play a card that matches the color or number of the card on top of the discard pile.</li>
                        <li>If a player cannot play, they must draw a card from the draw pile. If this card can be played, they may play it immediately; otherwise, they keep it and the turn passes to the next player.</li>
                        <li>Players must shout "Uno" when they have only one card left in hand. If they forget and another player notices before the turn passes, they must draw 2 cards as a penalty.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>End of the Game:</strong>
                    <p>The game ends when a player has no cards left. The other players count the points of their remaining cards. Numbered cards (2 to 10) are worth their face value, face cards (jacks, queens, kings) are worth 10 points, and jokers are worth 15 points. The player with the fewest points at the end of the game is the winner.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Variants of Homemade Uno:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Penalty Cards:</strong> Add penalty cards that force players to draw extra cards or skip their turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Change Cards:</strong> Use jokers to allow players to change the game color at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Combo Rules:</strong> Allow players to play multiple cards of the same value in one turn (e.g., two 5 of hearts).</li>
                <li><strong>End Game Rules:</strong> Instead of playing until a player gets rid of all their cards, you can play multiple rounds and count points at the end of each round.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge Cards:</strong> Introduce cards that require players to complete challenges, like singing a song or doing a dance, before they can play.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strategic Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Card Management:</strong> Try to keep a variety of colors and values in your hand to have more options during your turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Observation of Opponents:</strong> Pay attention to the cards that other players play and discard. This can give you clues about the cards they have in hand.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of Jokers:</strong> Jokers are powerful cards. Use them wisely to change the game color or to block an opponent.</li>
                <li><strong>Shouting "Uno" on Time:</strong> Don't forget to shout "Uno" when you have only one card left. If you forget, you risk losing extra cards.</li>
                <li><strong>Anticipation:</strong> Try to anticipate the moves of other players. If you think a player is about to get rid of their cards, try to play cards that might prevent them from doing so, like penalty cards or jokers to change the color.</li>

        <section id="belote">
            <h2>Belote</h2>
            <img src="image_belote.jpg" alt="Belote">
            <p><strong>Number of players:</strong> 4 players (in teams of 2).</p>
            <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A deck of 32 cards (the cards from 7 to 10, face cards, and aces of each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades).</p>
            <h3>Game Objective:</h3>
            <p>The objective of Belote is to score as many points as possible by winning tricks and making announcements (like Belote and Rebelote).</p>
            <h3>Card Values:</h3>
            <h4>Trump:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Jack: 20 points</li>
                <li>9: 14 points</li>
                <li>Ace: 11 points</li>
                <li>10: 10 points</li>
                <li>Queen: 3 points</li>
                <li>8 and 7: 0 points</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Non-Trump:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ace: 11 points</li>
                <li>10: 10 points</li>
                <li>Queen: 3 points</li>
                <li>Jack: 2 points</li>
                <li>9: 0 points</li>
                <li>8 and 7: 0 points</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Game Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dealing Cards:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each player receives 8 cards, dealt in two rounds (4 cards each time).</li>
                        <li>The remaining cards form the draw pile, and the first card from the draw pile is turned over to determine the trump suit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bidding and Choosing Trump:</strong>
                    <p>The player to the left of the dealer starts the bidding. They can choose to "take" the trump (i.e., play with the suit of the turned card) or pass. If a player takes, they must announce a number of points they think they can achieve (at least 82 points to win). If all players pass, a new card is turned over, and the process repeats until a player takes or all cards have been turned over.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Announcements:</strong>
                    <p>Players can make announcements of Belote and Rebelote. This occurs when the player has the king and queen of trump in hand. This earns an additional 20 points. Announcements can also include "tierces" (three consecutive cards of the same suit) and "quatuors" (four cards of the same value).</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Game Progression:</strong>
                    <p>The player who has taken starts by playing a card. The other players must follow the suit if possible. If they do not have a card of the requested suit, they can play a trump card or a card of another suit. The player who plays the highest card in the requested suit or the highest trump wins the trick. The player who wins the trick starts the next round.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>End of the Game:</strong>
                    <p>The game ends when all cards have been played. Points are counted based on the tricks won and the announcements. The team that has taken must have at least the number of points they announced to win. If they do not reach it, the other team scores the points.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Points:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trick Points:</strong> Points from the cards won in tricks.</li>
                <li><strong>Announcement Points:</strong> Additional points for announcements of Belote, Rebelote, tierces, and quatuors.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Variants of Belote:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Counter Belote:</strong> A variant where players can "counter" the opponent's announcement, which changes the rules for counting points.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-player Belote:</strong> A simplified version played with two players.</li>
                <li><strong>Three-player Belote:</strong> A version played with three players, where the player without a partner plays against the other two.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Belote:</strong> Teams of 3 or 4 players, where players change partners each round.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strategies and Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Communication with Partner:</strong> Although verbal communication is limited, players can use subtle signals to indicate the strength of their hand.</li>
                <li><strong>Management of Trumps:</strong> Keep your trumps for critical moments. Do not play them too early.</li>
