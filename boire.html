            <h2>Asshole</h2>
            <p><strong>Number of players:</strong> 4 or more players.</p>
            <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> A standard deck of cards and drinks for each player.</p>
            <h3>Game Objective:</h3>
            <p>The objective of Asshole is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards. The last player to do so becomes the "Asshole" for the next round and must follow specific rules.</p>
            <h3>Game Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dealing Cards:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All cards are dealt evenly to each player. Players keep their cards hidden from others.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Starting the Game:</strong>
                    <p>The player with the lowest card (usually the 3 of clubs) starts the game by playing that card. Players must play a higher card or pass.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Playing Cards:</strong>
                    <p>Players take turns playing cards. If a player cannot play a higher card, they must pass. If everyone passes, the last player to play can start a new round with any card.</p></li>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong>
                    <p>The first player to get rid of all their cards becomes the "President" in the next round. The last player to get rid of their cards becomes the "Asshole."</p></li>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Special Rules:</strong>
                    <p>Players in the President and Asshole positions have specific privileges and penalties in the next round:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The President can give their worst cards to the Asshole in exchange for better cards.</li>
                        <li>The Asshole must deal the cards for the next round.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Variants of Asshole:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>President:</strong> A variation where the roles of President and Asshole are emphasized, with additional rules for card exchanges.</li>
                <li><strong>Drunk Asshole:</strong> A drinking version where players must drink when they pass or when they lose a round.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strategic Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Save High Cards:</strong> Hold onto your high cards for strategic plays later in the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Observe Other Players:</strong> Pay attention to the cards played by others to gauge their hand strength.</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate with Your Team:</strong> If playing in teams, coordinate with your teammates to maximize your chances of winning.</li>
                <li><strong>Have Fun:</strong> Enjoy the social aspect of the game and the interactions with other players!</li>
